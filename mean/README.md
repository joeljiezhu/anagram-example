# MEAN

This is an example build with M(ongodb)E(xpress)A(ngular)N(ode.js)

They are separate in different directory, because we have different Dockerfile for each,
and want to show each one on their own.

## Mongo

You can use the script we create in the `mean/mongo` folder, and run mongo on your computer (need docker or podman instead first)

```sh
#todo
```
## Express

This is a super simple REST API, and we are going to re-use this in several other examples.
